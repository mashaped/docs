#### Warning {#warning}

Significant changes that may affect the integration with the API, and which may require additional code development on your side:

- [GetStateInstance](/../docs/api/account/GetStateInstance/) method response has been changed. The method returns a new "starting" status;
- The [stateInstanceChanged](/../docs/api/receiving/notifications-format/StateInstanceChanged/) incoming webhook body has been changed. The stateInstance parameter may take a "starting" value;
- The [body of all incoming webhooks](/../docs/api/receiving/notifications-format/incoming-message/Webhook-IncomingMessageReceived/) has been changed. The [chatName](/../docs/api/receiving/notifications-format/incoming-message/Webhook-IncomingMessageReceived/) field is added to the body of an incoming webhook;
- The [body of all incoming messages](/../docs/api/receiving/notifications-format/incoming-message/Webhook-IncomingMessageReceived/) when receiving forwarded messages has been changed. Fields: "forwardingScore", "isForwarded" have been added to the body of an incoming webhook;
- The [body of extended text incoming webhooks](/../docs/api/receiving/notifications-format/incoming-message/ExtendedTextMessage/) when receiving advertisement messages has been changed. Fields: "previewType", "containsAutoReply", "mediaType", "showAdAttribution", "sourceId", "sourceType", "sourceUrl", "thumbnailUrl" have been added to the body of an incoming webhook;
- Added new types of incoming webhooks: [ContactsArrayMessage](/../docs/api/receiving/notifications-format/incoming-message/ContactsArrayMessage/), [StickerMessage](/../docs/api/receiving/notifications-format/incoming-message/StickerMessage/), [ReactionMessage](/../docs/api/receiving/notifications-format/incoming-message/ReactionMessage/), [GroupInviteMessage](/../docs/api/receiving/notifications-format/incoming-message/GroupInviteMessage/);
- The mechanism for processing links in messages has changed [SendMessage](/../docs/api/sending/SendMessage/). If there is a link in the text, the fields from opengraph will automatically complete the message, so that this does not happen please use the linkpreview parameter. [SendLink](/../docs/api/sending/SendLink/) method is not used anymore.
