[Javascript library](https://github.com/green-api/whatsapp-api-client-js) for integration with WhatsAPP messenger via API of [green-api.com](https://green-api.com) service. To use the library you have to get a registration token and an account id in the [personal area](https://console.green-api.com). There is a free developer account tariff plan.

#### API

You can find REST API documentation by [url](https://green-api.com/docs/api/). The library is a wrapper for REST API, so the documentation at the above url applies to the library as well.

#### Authorization 

To send a message or to execute some other Green-API method, you have to have the WhatsApp account in the phone application to be authorized. To authorize your account please go to the [personal area](https://console.green-api.com) and scan a QR-code using the WhatsApp application.
