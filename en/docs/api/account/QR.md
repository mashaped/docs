# QR

The method is aimed for getting QR code. 
To authorize your account, you have to scan a QR code from application [WhatsApp Business](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/) on your phone.
You can also get a QR code and authorize your account in your profile. The procedure for authorizing an account in your profile is described in section [Before you start](../../before-start.md#qr).

> QR code is updated every 20 seconds, therefore, it is recommended to request the method for getting a QR code with a delay in 1 second.

To get a QR code, the account must have an unauthorized status. If the account is authorized, you have first to log out the account using [Logout](Logout.md) method.
After sucessful scanning a QR code and authorizing the account [incoming notification](../receiving/index.md) in form of [Account Status](../receiving/notifications-format/StateInstanceChanged.md) is generated.

> You can also get a QR code via [websocket-connection](Scanqrcode.md)
